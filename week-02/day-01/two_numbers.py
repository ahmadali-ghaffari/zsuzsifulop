# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
a=13 
b=22
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
add = a+b
print(add)
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
substracted = b-a
print(substracted)
# Print the result of 22 mutiplied by 13
multiply=a*b
print(multiply)
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
divide=b / a
print(divide)
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
div2=b // a
print(div2)
# Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13
div3=b % a
print(div3)
