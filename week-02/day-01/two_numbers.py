# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
# Print the result of 22 mutiplied by 13
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
# Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13

b = 22

add = a + b
substracted = b - a
multiply = a * b
divide = b / a

div3 = b % a
